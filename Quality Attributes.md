| ID | Quality Attribute | Scenario | Associated Use Case |
|----|-------------------|-----------|---------------------|
|  QA1  |        Performance           |   Notifications, responses, and queries should be generated or delivered within 2 seconds on average under normal load, ensuring smooth interaction.        |        UC-2, UC-4            |
|  QA2  |        Usability           |     The system interface should allow users to easily locate academic or administrative information within three clicks.      |       UC-1              |
|  QA3  |      Modifiability              |   The system should allow administrators to update institutional policies or integrations without interrupting other features.        |     UC-5, UC-7                |
|  QA4  |     Security              |     Only verified instructors should be able to upload or modify course materials to prevent unauthorized access.      |       UC-3              |
|  QA5  |      Availability             |    The system should automatically detect and recover from failures to maintain 99.5% uptime during critical operations.       |      UC-2, UC-4, UC-7, UC-8               |
|  QA6  |        Scalability           |     The system should efficiently handle up to 5,000 concurrent users without degradation in performance or response time.      |        All  UCs           |
|  QA7  |      Reliability             |     The system should remain functional and display accurate results even when multiple users access it simultaneously.      |      UC-4, UC-8               |
|  QA8  |     Interoperability        |     The platform should exchange and synchronize data across different institutional using standard APIs      |   UC-5, UC-8   |
