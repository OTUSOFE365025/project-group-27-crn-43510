## Business Case
                                                                 
As technology is rapidly advancing continuously, its usage has become an essential part of daily operations used by multiple types of companies and organizations, which also includes universities. Universities have incorporated new technology and software tools to manage their university system operations more efficiently. However, sometimes being able to effectively manage and coordinate the external university systems could get complicated and challenging in order to provide efficient information and manage all the data; causing challenges and negative impacts on the university's stakeholders such as students, lecturers, administrators, system maintainers, and data source systems overall.

In order to solve and manage these inefficiencies and challenges, an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform (AIDAP) is going to be designed to provide an interactive interface which will be able to effectively manage the university requirements and operations while improving communication amongst the stakeholders. By integrating with the university's external systems and use of artificial intelligence, AIDAP will be able to help the overall system be able to provide more efficient and accurate answers, managing all inquiries and operations requested by the stakeholders at a very fast pace. Some examples of this could be a student receiving updates and notifications about their schedule changes, upcoming exams, events, and deadlines, a lecturer being able to see classroom analytics such as grades and attendence, and the system responding to the queries within 2 seconds.

Design Purpose: This is a greenfield system in a mature domain, and the purpose is to produce a sufficiently detailed design to support the construction of the system.
