## Business Case
                                                                 
As technology has begun continuously advancing rapidly, its usage has become an important part of everyone's lives as a valuable asset used by multiple types of companies and organizations, such as universities. Universities have incorporated new technology and software tools to manage their university systems. However, sometimes being able to effectively manage and handle the external university systems could get complicated and challenging in order to provide efficient information and manage all the data, causing challenges and negative impacts on the university's stakeholders such as students, lecturers, administrators, system maintainers, and data source systems overall.

In order to solve and manage these inefficiencies and challenges, an AI-Powered Digital Assistant Platform is going to be designed to provide an interactive interface which will be able to effectively manage the university requirements and operations while improving communication amongst the stakeholders. Through the assistant integrating its operations with the university's external systems along with the use of artificial intelligence, the overall system will be able to provide more efficient answers, managing all inquiries and operations requested by the stakeholders.
