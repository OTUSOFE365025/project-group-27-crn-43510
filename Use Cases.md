## Use Cases
| Use Case | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **UC-1: Query Academic / Administrative Information** | Users interact with the assistant via text or voice to ask about class schedules, deadlines, policies, analytics, etc. The AI interprets and retrieves relevant information from institutional databases. |
| **UC-2: Receive Notifications and Announcements** | The Assistant sends notifications such as deadlines, schedule changes, and campus announcements to relevant users. |
| **UC-3: Manage and Publish Course Materials** | Lecturers can upload, modify, or remove course content through conversational commands, and students can access it via AIDAP. |
| **UC-4: Access and Analyze Academic Analytics** | Provides summarized dashboards showing grades, attendance, engagement, and institutional metrics to support decision-making. |
| **UC-5: Manage Integrations and Policies** | Administrators configure institutional system integrations (LMS, registration, calendars) and define data retention and privacy policies. |
| **UC-6: Authenticate and Personalize User Experience** | The system authenticates users via institutional SSO (Single Sign-On) and personalizes responses using stored history and user preferences (such as notifications and language). |
| **UC-7: Monitor and Maintain System Health** | Maintainers track system health, latency, and errors via dashboards, and deploy updates with zero downtime using continuous deployment pipelines. |
| **UC-8: Synchronize Institutional Data** | External systems such as LMS, Registration, Calendar, and Email automatically exchange data with AIDAP to keep institutional information updated at configurable intervals. |
